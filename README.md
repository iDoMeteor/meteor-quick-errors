# Meteor Errors

Some quick and simple code for dropping into Meteor code when you don't want
to mess around with a bunch of other stuff. :>

Consider it v0.0.1 and un-tested, I wrote it a while ago.  I had big plans
for a whole thing.. but, point is now moot.  Therefore, maybe it will become
a plan for a whole tiny thing.
